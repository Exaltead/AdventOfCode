# Advent of Code Year 2024
Chosen language: f#

## To generate new day

For new day run 
`dotnet new console -lang F# -o dayX`

## Day reviews

### Day 1

Traditional wake-up task, nothing hard but got to refresh memory on f# list manipulations

### Day 2

Straightforward list manipulations for both parts. Part1 was simple and part2 fast to brute force

### Day 3

Regex day, simple but good refreshment for regex use (both parts)


### Day 4

Grid walking, fairly clear but had some work to do.

### Day 5

Custom sorting systems, fairly straight forward part 1 but unclear part 2. Would say that the part 2 for given solution was far easier than the part1 was.

### Day 6
Part 1 was fairly clear trail tracking exercise but part2 was actually fun. Had to think for a bit and optimize a few times. One issue was that the test input did not cover most of the pitfalls, so had to just guess/deduce what the issue might be.

### Day7
Was nice and refreshing especially simple

### Day8
Looked far more annoying than it actually was.
